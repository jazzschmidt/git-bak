NAME
    git-bak - Backup a Git repository

SYNOPSIS
    git-bak [-x] [-f archive] -u url

DESCRIPTION
    Backups a Git repository by bundling it with all its references. The bundle is then packed as tar ball.
    The archive will be placed in the current directory by default.

    Unless otherwise specified via '-x' or '--no-script', a simple script to conveniently clone the bundle into
    the current directory is added to the archive.

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file <FILE>   Custom path for the generated tar ball
    -u, --url <URL>     Tells which url to clone the Git repository from
    -h, --help          Shows this help message
    -v, --verbose       Increases verbosity
    -x, --no-script     Skips creation of the clone script

EXAMPLES:
    Backup a remote repository that is saved as 'repo.tar.gz' in the current directory along with the clone script.

        git-bak -u https://example.com/projects/repo.git
````

## Example Usage
#### Create the Backup
````lang=shell
$ ./git-bak -u https://github.com/jazzschmidt/git-bak.git -f archive.tar.gz
````

#### Unpack the archive somewhere
````lang=shell
$ tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
$ ls -loh
total 112
-rw-r--r--  1 user    23K Apr 16 17:16 archive.tar.gz
-rwxr-xr-x  1 user   163B Apr 16 17:16 checkout
-rw-r--r--  1 user    24K Apr 16 17:16 gitbundle
````

#### Clone the repository
Either directly click on the `checkout` script or call it from the terminal. By using the latter, it is also possible to define another directory to clone to.
````lang=shell
$ ./checkout ~/workspace/project
Cloning into '/Users/user/workspace/project'...
